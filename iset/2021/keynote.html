                                        <h4>Seeing the Future of Education: A Three-Year Experiment of Digital Reading Online Course</h4>
                                        <p>The history of the evolution of education and media technology from oral to Internet shows that literacy has developed from the oracy, via the print-based literacy, to the digital literacy. In the ecosystem of Internet, the form of reading materials is changing from printed books to digital multimedia contents, including e-books, video, audio, VR, games, etc. Todays, the form of teaching is changing from face-to-face classroom to online classroom mediated by ICT. The change of teaching methods has further brought about a new paradigm of educational research. Based on this background, the Digital Reading Laboratory in the Graduate School of Education, Peking University conducted an experiment on online digital reading courses during 2015 to 2018 in cooperation with three middle schools. This paper will describe this experiment and report the findings.</p>

                                        <h2>Prof. Jimmy Ho Man Lee</h2>
                                        <h4>The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China</h4>
                                        <p>Jimmy Lee obtained both his BMath (Hons) and MMath degrees at the University of Waterloo, and completed his doctoral studies at the University of Victoria.  Upon graduation, he joined The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK), where he is now Associate Dean (Education) in the Faculty of Engineering and Professor in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering.  His research interests lie in Artificial Intelligence in general and the theory and practice of Constraint Satisfaction and Optimization in particular.  His work entails applications in scheduling, resource allocation, and combinatorial problems.  He is also an amateur researcher in learning science and technology, focusing on the design of learning platforms and pedagogies for enhancing students' learning experience.  During 2017-18, Jimmy joined hands with Peter Stuckey (then) at the University of Melbourne to launch a series of MOOCs on Coursera in both Chinese and English on modeling and solving discrete optimization problems using the Fantasy-based Learning approach, and received good feedback from the learners' community.  Jimmy is a two-time recipient (2004 and 2015) of the CUHK Vice-Chancellor’s Exemplary Teaching Award and was bestowed in 2017 the CUHK University Education Award, the highest honour in education at CUHK.</p>
                                        <h4>From MOOC to SPOC: Fable-based Learning</h4>
                                        <p>This presentation gives the pedagogical innovations and experience of the co-development of three MOOCs on the subject of "Modeling and Solving Discrete Optimization Problems'' by The Chinese University of Hong Kong and the University of Melbourne.  In a nutshell, the MOOCs feature the Fable-Based Learning approach, which is a form of problem-based learning encapsulated in a coherent story plot.  Each lecture video begins with an animation that tells a story based on a classic novel.  The protagonists of the story encounter a problem requiring technical assistance from the two professors from modern time via a magical tablet granted to them by a fairy god. The new pedagogy aims at increasing learners' motivation and interests as well as situating the learners in a coherent learning context. In addition to scriptwriting, animation production and embedding the teaching materials in the story plot, another challenge of the project is the remote distance between the two institutions as well as the need to produce all teaching materials in both (Mandarin) Chinese and English to cater for different geographic learning needs.  The MOOCs have been running recurrently on Coursera since 2017.  We present learner statistics and feedback, and discuss our experience with and preliminary observations of adopting the online materials in a Flipped Classroom setting.</p>

                                        <h4>Sogang University, Seoul, Korea</h4>

                                        <h4>The Meaning of Learner Centeredness in Higher Education Revisited</h4>
                                        <p>This keynote addresses the meaning of ‘learner centered’ education at a time when university students and educators all over the world are (or have been) inevitably thrust into, due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Going online for months surely tests the ability of educators to deliver student centered and interactive learning in a challenging environment. Learner centeredness, in general, implies learning in which the learner’s responsibilities and activities are emphasized compared to that of the instructor. This does not mean that the educator’s role is weakened. Professors must be active in providing feedback about misconceptions and confusions to help students grow into experts. They should also clarify the relation between class projects with the course objectives and the real world, and help students with low competence develop strategies when solving open-ended problems. Students want to think like an expert and apply their skills for solving real world problems. They also desire academic growth by modelling deep insight from their professors. The educator’s role for providing meaningful guidance has become more critical than ever especially for first or second year students who may need much scaffolding for their intellectual development. However, when online classes are carried out for a prolonged time, students’ self-regulation subsides, and the yearn for ‘togetherness’ rises, making it difficult to maintain learner centeredness. Specific examples and their underlying principles of the support provided to students and educators for overcoming their difficulties in 2020 will be discussed in the presentation.</p>

                                        <h4>From Nine Events of Instruction to the First Principles of Instruction: Transformation of Learning Architecture for Society 5.0</h4>
                                        <p>This keynote addresses a needed shift in designing learning architecture for transforming education to meet the needs of Society 5.0, Super Smart Society. The 9 events of instruction, a traditional instructional design theory proposed in the 1970's by Robert M. Gagne, will be reviewed as the framework for facilitating human learning based on information processing theory. It will then be compared with a more recent framework of the First Principles of Instruction, proposed by M. David Merrill in 2002, reflecting various theories and models proposed based on constructivist psychology. Similarities and differences will be discussed to suggest how to utilize them as an architectural framework for blended learning design toward a more learner-centered self-directed learning environment. </p>
