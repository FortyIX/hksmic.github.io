                            <h5 class="mb-10">Hospital and Church of the Holy Trinity in Kuks</h5>
                            <div class="float-left"><img src="img/hospital.jpg" class="responsive pr-30 pt-10 pb-10"></div>
                            <p class="text-break responsive-text">East Bohemian Kuks is one of the most beautiful Baroque complexes in the Czech Republic. Set out to discover the story of a place which in its heyday easily equalled the largest spa towns in Bohemia and whose architectural value amazes visitors from all over the world to this very day. Walk through the gallery of beautiful statues by the “Czech Michelangelo” or view the Nativity Scene hewn directly from the rocks, the only one of its kind in the world.</p>
                            <p class="text-break">This beautiful little village with its many log buildings is dominated on the opposite bank of the river by a monumental Baroque complex, which was once one of the most important spa locations in the Czech lands. Count Špork decided to establish a spa sanatorium at the end of the 17th century after a healing spring was found here. The rich cultural life of the spa in the form of sumptuous balls, plays and hunts became legendary. Even though this fame has passed with time, you will to this very day be overwhelmed by the magnificence and beauty of the Baroque in its purest of forms.</p>
                            <h5 class="mb-10">Josefov Fortress</h5>
                            <div class="float-right"><img src="img/fortress.jpg" class="responsive pl-30 pt-10 pb-10"></div>
                            <p class="text-break">The Josefov Fortress is a remarkable structure whose chequered past you will learn about on an engaging guided tour. It was built in 1788 on the orders of Emperor Joseph II, and its mighty fortification walls along with its underground corridors were meant to defend the Austrian monarchy against frequent Prussian incursions. The fort was a giant arsenal, a storehouse for gunpowder and supplies, and also provided accommodation for soldiers and civilians. A guided tour will take you through the tangle of underground corridors and familiarize you with the travails of military life. For the stout-hearted, especially children with their parents, haunted tours accompanied by gripping legends are held regularly.</p>

                            <h4 class="mt-20 mb-20">Route 2. Tour of the city Hradec Králové</h4>
                            <h5 class="mb-10">White Tower and Cathedral of the Holy Spirit</h5>
                            <div class="float-left"><img src="img/gallery.jpg" class="responsive pr-30 pt-10 pb-10"></div>
                            <p class="text-break">The White Tower standing at the very centre of the city is a majestic dominant feature of Hradec. It earned its name thanks to the bright colour of the Hořice sandstone it is constructed from. This Renaissance tower reaches the height of 72 metres and visitors can not only enjoy a beautiful view of Hradec, but also of the remote peaks of Krkonoše and the Orlické Mountains. The construction started in 1574 and it was financed by the donations of citizens. Seven years later, the impressive bell called Augustin, weighing eight tonnes, was hung on the fourth floor of the tower.</p>
                            <p class="text-break">In the vicinity of the tower, there is the Cathedral of the Holy Spirit, the history of which is enveloped in secrecy. The foundation deed of the church has not been preserved and, as such, we can only presume that it was built by Czech Queen Elizabeth Richeza in 1307.</p>
                            <h5 class="mb-10">The Gallery of Modern Art</h5>
                            <div class="float-right"><img src="img/tower.jpg" class="responsive pl-30 pt-10 pb-10"></div>
                            <p class="text-break">Hradec gallery is home to quite a unique collection within the Czech Republic as its depositary does not include any socialist realism (unlike most other collections). The gallery has a coherent collection of Czech cubism and a lot of surrealistic works of art from the 1920s to 1970s. Today, the 1953 gallery is seated in the art nouveau building at Velké náměstí. An interesting fact is that the idea to found a gallery started with the Bishop of Hradec, Doubrava, who donated his personal collection of artworks in his will in 1919.</p>

                            <h5 class="mb-10">Kutná Hora</h5>
                            <div class="float-left"><img src="img/kutnahora.jpg" class="responsive pr-30 pt-10 pb-10"></div>
                            <p class="text-break">Kutná Hora, the city of silver, is deservedly attributed the other name “national treasury”. This is to say that its wealth helped to ensure the boom of the Czech Kingdom. The centre of the city was included in the UNESCO world heritage list in 1995 thanks to its historical importance and architectural gems. All of the streets, houses and churches exude a long history full of important events. The symbol of Kutná Hora is the unique late Gothic Cathedral of St. Barbara.</p>
                            <h5 class="mb-10">Ossuary</h5>
                            <div class="float-right"><img src="img/ossuary.jpg" class="responsive pl-30 pt-10 pb-10"></div>
                            <p class="text-break">The world-renowned ossuary at Sedlec just outside Kutná Hora is a medieval Gothic chapel that has stood on the remains of 40,000 people for centuries, offering a quiet reminder of the transience of human life and the existence of death. Today, visitors from around the world are astonished by its bizarre decorations made from human bones in the form of chandeliers, a pyramid, crosses and coats of arms. Visit and you too will discover the story of a fascinating place that ranks as one of the most mystical in the Czech Republic.</p>
