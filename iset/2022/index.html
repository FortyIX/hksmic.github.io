								<p>Broadly covering instructional technology, information and communication technology for educational purposes, educational technology aims to enhance learning outcome and enrich learning experience through the effective and innovative use of technology. It has become an irreversible force driving changes in teaching and learning practices, not only on the learning materials but also the learning process.</p>
								<p>ISET 2022 aims to provide a platform for knowledge exchange and experience sharing among researchers and practitioners in the field. The symposium theme is Technological Innovation: Engaging Students in the New Normal Era. Original papers reporting research results or novel applications of educational technology are especially welcome. ISET 2022 covers topics related to educational technology including, but not limited to:</p>
									<ul>
									<li>E-learning and online learning</li>
									<li>Game-based learning</li>
									<li>Improved Flexibility of Learning Process</li>
									<li>Institutional policies and strategies</li>
									<li>Instructional technology</li>
									<li>Learning analytics and education big data</li>
									<li>Massive open online courses</li>
									<li>Mobile Learning and Ubiquitous Learning</li>
									<li>Online platform and environment</li>
									<li>Open education resources</li>
									<li>Personalized learning</li>

								<h3>The Joyous Paradox of Making the Multitude the Norm: Blended Learning as a Reconstructive Act</h3>
								<p><b>ABSTRACT.</b> As educational decision makers and learning design professionals alike explore how to move beyond emergency measures enacted during the pandemic, much conversation centers around the idea of the “new normal.” In this paper, I explore the idea of the “new normal” along with why blended learning has such strong appeal as both a micro and macro strategy. Metamodernist theory helps to frame the discussion on how seemingly contradictory ideas may be brought together and how blending is a form of reconstruction.</p>

								<h3>Nurturing Socially Responsible Global Citizens through Blended Learning: A Journey through Technology-Enhanced Service-Learning</h3>
								<p><b>ABSTRACT.</b> Global Citizenship and Social Responsibility are attributes that we wish all our students to have. Service-learning has been shown to be effective at nurturing these attitudes in students, and as such, it has been gaining in popularity in higher education, in Hong Kong and worldwide. However, COVID-19 brought many service projects to a screeching halt. Forced to adapt, many teachers adapted techniques from their online teaching for service-learning. From these stopgap approaches grew innovations that consider blended learning and online communications not just as a Plan B, but as a critical part of the learning experience which could not be achieved otherwise. This paper describes some of these innovations, and suggests some salient issues that have to be addressed for student learning to be successful.</p>

								<h3>Transitioning eLearning in a Transitioning Instructional World</h3>
								<p><b>ABSTRACT.</b> Because of Covid 19, remote teaching (oftentimes called eLearning), once a supplementary mode of instruction, has emerged as the primary method of teaching at all levels of education. Open Educational Resources (OER), a previously underused resource, can be an important source of content in the emergent eLearning environments. This session explores the importance of conventional course syllabi, revitalized and enhanced by OERs, in enhancing those virtual teaching/learning environments. It then explores some future scenarios for eLearning in a post-pandemic world. </p>

								<h3>Future Education and Talents Cultivation: A Knowledge Building Approach</h3>
								<p><b>ABSTRACT.</b> New era of 21st century and knowledge society required new talents with creative thinking and problem-solving skills, which has become a base for cultivating the new talents for future education. Education transformation has been becoming a popular issue currently in the field of basic and higher education. The representative typical approach of education transformation is knowledge-dominated approach which has been transmitted to competence-based approach. This paper investigates the theoretical base for supporting future education and talents cultivation. A Knowledge Building Approach (KBA) has been applied to explore the way for exploring the new talents cultivation. Based on the results of two experimental studies, the KBA can be used for improving students’ problem-solving and creative thinking skills. </p>
