                                Disruptive technology is challenging traditional education management and education service way as changing pedagogy in teaching and learning. This speech presents how typical education innovations driven by disruptive technology is improving education, and reveals how traditional education system hinders application of disruptive technology in education. The speech is based on a comprehensive study, aimed to provide policy-level suggestions on how to rebuild education system, supporting innovative education practice by disruptive technology. The study adopted ethnography as methodology with case study as the main method. With analysis model of three dimensions - teaching and learning, education management, and education service, the research team chose over a hundred innovative education cases influenced by disruptive technology in mainland China. The research team find out how education innovation cases improve the education, and what kinds of features of system can breed and support effective education innovation by interviewing innovators and collecting evidences. At the end of the study, the research team found out that traditional school system is not suitable for education in knowledge Economy era. Now education system is integrating into society. It is significant that we have to rebuild a new system to support personalized learning, refined management and social participation.

                                <p><b>Visualizing Student Learning Progression Pattern Using Neural Network and Hierarchical Clustering Analysis</b><br />
                                Motivating students to learn and continuous improvement of course materials are necessary and vital for the benefits of the students who participate in online courses. It is crucial to provide guidance on how to effectively use the course materials. This study aims to develop a method to identify progression patterns among students who successfully completed the course. This can help students to navigate through the course and instructors to understand more on how to organize the course materials. Traditional mining techniques such as prefix span can mine student’s platform usage patterns, yet, they do not provide a complete learning progression sequence of how course materials are related to one another. To collectively identify the learning progression pattern of successful candidates, this study proposes a descriptive model using a neural network with hierarchical clustering method. We fragment the learning path of successors into triplets and use a neural network to learn their inter-relationship in an unsupervised manner. The inter-relationship can then be visualized through fixing pre-test as the start point of the sequence to post-test as the endpoint based on the hierarchical clustering results. We have applied this technique to 3 classes of students in a statistics course. The learning sequence of successful learners revealed by the proposed method are similar across cohorts.

                                <p><b>The Challenge for Higher Education Reform in Japan by Seven Samurai</b><br />
                                In June 1996, seven researchers in their mid-thirties, who were computer related scientists, were gathered and entrusted to make a new university from scratch. As a result, the learning environment to be introduced in this keynote was developed, and the school building was awarded the Architectural Institute of Japan Prize. The philosophy behind the university's spirit became "Open space, Open mind."<br />
                                There was a lot of turbulence in the process of creating a new university. Many dark clouds were disturbing us. The way to create a university was very steep and required us to overcome many obstacles. Finally though our university evolved through innovation and foresight that never comes from a plan prepared by a think tank specializing in the creation of a university. I believe we became the "Seven Samurai" in Higher Education reform in Japan.<br />
                                The first thing we did when we started designing the university was to ask ourselves about the meaning of learning. What is learning? No matter how much we teach, people may not necessarily learn. "Learning" is a different issue from "teaching." We started rethinking about learning.<br />
                                In this keynote I will give an autobiographical account of our unique university that has been designed and implemented from scratch and, of course, is still in operation. The focus is not only to look back at past developments, but also to extract essences and principles for designing sustainable learning environments.  I will discuss the design of the learning environment as a whole, and argue that the challenge of effective design should be expanded from the conventional blend of real and digital classroom environments to a new perspective that coordinates space, activity and community.<br />

                                <p><b>Models of Blended Learning for Two Critical Populations—Adults Requiring Patient Education and Adults Retraining for Career Re-entry</b><br />
                                For the past two decades, we have studied the emergence of educational technologies, courseware, and learning management systems within American K-12, undergraduate, graduate, and professional development programs. Our approach focused on perspectives grounded in theories of cognition and learning as well as in behavioral change. However, while technologies and systems facilitating blended learning have been implemented, we still have much to learn and, perhaps more importantly, there are critical adult populations that remain underserved by educational outreach. We have observed increased focus on education of two critical populations in the United States: (1) adult patients, especially those with chronic illnesses that consume the major portion of healthcare resources; and (2) adults with education at or below a high school level who have difficulty finding employment during shifts in global economic patterns demanding higher-level skills for technology-oriented jobs.<br />
                                In this keynote, we will present models of blended learning that have at least some evidence base for improving educational outcomes. These models can be mapped to different types of educational levels and programs, with a particular focus on how blended learning could improve both patient and adult basic education. Our approach involves an analysis focused on cognition and learning. This approach reflects how and why different models for blended learning should be adapted for individuals at different developmental stages. For example, how do we create blended learning models that best suit elementary and secondary level school children, which are appropriate for undergraduate students, which for graduate students, and which are most likely to succeed with different types of adult learners for improved health care, professional development, or career re-entry? In closing, we will present a set of recommendations for how and why to develop new models of blended learning that integrate educational technologies in a sensible and evidence-based manner.

In 2016, Prof. Tashiro became a faculty member and Education Technology Coach in the Pima Community College Adult Basic Education for College and Career Readiness.<br />
                                His research has focused on the relationships between evidence-based learning and evidence-based practice in education, with total extramural funding for research and development grants now more than USD $20.6 million. At UOIT, he helped develop and implement the Heath Education Technology Research Unit, the Health Information Management Program, and Graduate Program in the Faculty of Health Sciences. Tashiro also built and evaluated courses and educational simulations that promote interprofessional collaborative patient-centered care. Recent work in Hong Kong and the United States led to the Maxit Education Systems hardware-software platform that provides new types of assessments of learning-skills outcomes at all levels of education. A particular emphasis has been development of teaching-learning-assessment systems that can track and analyze misconception development during learning. From 2000 to Present, Prof. Tashiro and his colleagues have developed suites of virtual clinical simulations that monitor learners’ choices during treatment of complex patients within the simulations. The principal focus of the monitoring system has been assessment of clinical judgment, with the software conducting automated analyses of choices made by the learner while working within a simulation.<br /></p>
