			<p><b>Abstract</b></p>
			<p>Lots of research has been done on smart cities, however, only few studies can be found on smart cities from the educational perspective. We will discuss the framework of building smart city from educational perspective to identify the importance for building smart learning environments in smart cities. Then we will analyze the typical learning environments in cities: school/university, family, community, workplace, and museum. Based on the analysis, we develop the indicators to evaluate learning environments in smart cities. In the end, we will discuss the characters of smart learning, and analyze the difference of traditional classroom learning, digital learning and smart learning.</p>
			<p>This keynote will cover the framework for building smart cities, the typical learning environments in smart cities, the indicators for evaluating learning environments in smart cities and the characters of smart learning.</p>

				<h4>International Collaborative Project-Based Learning: How did US and Japanese students learn together at a distance when supported by ICT? </h4>
				<h5><b>Kenichi Kubota</b></h5>
				<h5>
				Ph.D. (Indiana University, Instructional Systems Technology)<br />
				Professor, Kansai University, Faculty of Informatics<br />
				Former president of Japan Association for Educational Media Study<br />
				Trustee of Japan Society for Educational Technology

			<p><b>Abstract</b></p>
			<p>Technological advancement, for example Web 2.0, has supported new learning paradigms such as blended, distance, collaborative, and cross-cultural learning. However, instructional methods in Japanese universities are still traditional. ICT, as a collaborative media incorporated into learning activities, is a possible direction for 21st century education.  The author introduces two cases of distance collaborative learning between University of Hawaii campuses in Honolulu, USA and Kansai University, Osaka, Japan. The first case is a year-long program for undergraduate students studying environmental science. Starting with video conferencing between US and Japan, the students became acquainted with each other. Then, Japanese students visited Hawaii and worked together to investigate invasive algae along the seashore. Next, US students came to Japan to study a satoyama ecosystem. This program consisted of both distance and face-to-face collaboration to prepare reports and produce video products. The second case is a semester-long graduate course. Japanese and US students collaboratively produced short video programs while working in teams at a distance. Teams from both countries encountered difficulties, but overcame them at the end of the program. Overall, most students were satisfied with their collaborative experiences.</p>

			<p><b>Abstract</b></p>
			<p>This keynote will present a research conducted within the elderly people in Czech Republic, which works as a pilot research to the representative study of ways how the elderly reach and develop their IT skills, particularly how social relationships work as movers within this process. The method of questionnaire was applied to the research sample of 432 respondents attending the University of the Third Age and IT courses held by the Municipality of Hradec Kralove. The results clearly proved that the elderly people meet the three predefined criteria for successful implementation of blended learning in this age group, as they both possess modern devices and have skills to exploit them successfully for various purposes. There are no limits showing their education should be excluded from the list.</p>

				<h4>The Case for Blended Learning</h4>
				<h5><b>Christian Wagner</b></h5>
				<h5>
				School of Creative Media<br />
				City University of Hong Kong<br />

			</div>
			<p><b>Abstract</b></p>
			<p>In the continuum between face-to-face and online courses, blended learning becomes a hybrid proposition, which, when successfully executed, balances and integrates the best of both learning models. Based on a reflection of the origins of face-to-face versus pure e-learning models and their corresponding benefits and challenges, this keynote makes a case of the usefulness of blended learning as a preferred, rather than a compromise learning model. The keynote will explore the benefits of decomposition of learning activities, the challenges of front-loading preparation activities, quality challenges, as well as the role of presence. The keynote will further raise questions about the economics of learning, critical mass, and blended learning medium and message. </p>
