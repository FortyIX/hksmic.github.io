							<p>The International Conference on Blended Learning (ICBL) is an annual international conference with the main focus on blended learning â€“ an integration of the traditional learning with innovative means, such as e-learning and open online learning, in order to create a new learning environment to enhance learning effectiveness and enrich learning experience. The purpose is to bring together researchers and developers from education and computer science to advance the research of blended learning.
                            </p>
						</div>
						<div class="col-lg-12">
							<p>ICBL is the continuation of the International Conference on Hybrid Learning (ICHL) series which started in 2008. Following the success of ICHL 2015, the ICHL 2015 Conference Chair and Programme Chair together with some other Organizing Committee members decided to continue the Conference with a new name ICBL, starting from 2016. This new name ICBL would better reflect the latest practice in the field, as it has become an established trend to integrate (not only to combine) the traditional learning with e-learning and other innovative means of learning (such as open education resources and social media) to create a blended learning environment to enhance learning effectiveness and enrich learning experience.
