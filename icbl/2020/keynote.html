                            <h4 class="mb-10">Learning analytics based on multilayer behavior fusion</h4>
                            <p>Learning analytics is the measurement, collection, and analysis of data about learners and their contexts for the purposes of understanding and optimizing the process of learning and the underlying environment. Due to the complex nature of the learning process, existing work mostly focuses on the modeling and analysis of single learning behavior and bears limited capacity in achieving good performance and interpretability of prediction tasks. In this talk, I will share our work on learning analytics based on multilayer behavior fusion,  which can achieve significantly better performance in various tasks including at-risk student prediction. Results of  extensive evaluation on thousands of students from two universities demonstrates the effectiveness of multilayer behavior fusion. I will report the insights about mining learning behaviors at different layers including physical, social and mental layers from the data collected from multiple sources. I will also describe the quantitative relationships between these behaviors and the students’ learning performance.</p>

                            <h4 class="mb-10">Mr. Karlcharn Kongkatong</h4><p>Solution One</p>
                            <p>Mr. Kongkatong is currently the CEO of one of Thailand’s largest mobile commerce (or m-Commerce) firms and a successful consultant in the telecommunication businesses.  He started Solution One Holding in 2002 as the country’s first mobile-application company.  Solution One became the first Thai company to aggregate musical works from international music label later in 2002 and joined Apple music and iTunes as a direct music partner in 2012.  Solution One Holding partnered with Youtube as a direct partner in 2012 and later moved to become its Multi-Channel Network or MCN in 2016.  Mr. Kongkatong pioneered in the entertainment industry in Thailand by becoming the first service provider which has distributed Korean and Myanmar musical work since 2005.</p>
                            <p>Before Solution One Holding, Mr. Kongkatong established S-One Telecom in 2000 to work with Nokia (Thailand) which resulted in the development of Club Nokia and CRM Platform for Nokia (Thailand).  S-One Telecom wrote EZ Thai Application, the first Thai Based Application for Symbian, bundled and sold with over 2.5 million phones from 2002-2007.  The company has operated as the first private SMS Gateway linked with all local operators from 2002-present (now as part of Solution One Holding).</p>
                            <p>For educational background, Mr. Kongkatong went to the US to start his Middle Year program.  After the completion at Westtown School in Pennsylvania, he continued his undergraduate education at University of Washington (Seattle, Washington) in Economics during 1986-1990. He completed his MBA program in Finance from Pepperdine University in California in1991.  Then, he returned to Thailand and had worked with Samart Corporation from 1992 until the start of S-One Telecom in 2000.</p>
                            <h4 class="mb-10">The Skill of Future Workforce in the Era of Business Disruptions</h4>
                            <p>To become a successful company or to maintain its success, there requires the specific set of skills of the workforce.  It is important to recognize that these skills are becoming increasingly more dynamics today, especially when facing with the transformation into the digital and shared society today.  Higher cognitive skills which involve creativity and innovation have to be part of skill development and training at higher education institutes.  In addition, social and emotional skills are needed when dealing with workplace synergy and customers.  Digital skills are absolutely the necessity for any firm regardless of the size due to digitalization of business operations.</p>
                            <p>My story includes business circumstances and trends during the last decade in which Solution One Holding has to overcome digital and business disruptions, regulatory challenges, and dramatic changes in consumer behavior.  The discussion will conclude with the key skill areas that business operators will likely need in the next decade.  Although many business operators have clearly identified these future skills, it appears that the contents for skill development are not totally effective.  It is hopeful that the CEO’s insights will lead to better content development which can be successfully disseminated through the combination of e- and blended Learning as a lack of sufficient skillful workforce has contributed to business interruptions and discontinuation.</p>

                            <p>Dr. Hugh O’Connell is managing director of ICDL Thailand - The International Computer Driving License, the world's leading computer skills certification. He has been resident in Thailand for almost 25 years and has a background in education and training. Hugh is working closely with the Thai Government to promote digital literacy in Thailand and align digital skills with the Thailand 4.0 initiative. As a result, in late 2016, ICDL programmes were the first digital literacy qualifications to be mapped to the Thai Qualifications framework, and are now being implemented throughout both the public and private sector. Prior to working with ICDL, Hugh has run his own business and taught at a number of universities at both the undergraduate and postgraduate level. He is a vice president of the Irish Thai Chamber of Commerce and actively works to promote mutually beneficial links between Ireland and Thailand.</p>
                            <h4 class="mb-10">Digital Transformation and Digital Literacy - Blended Learning in Action</h4>
                            <p>The talk will consider the driving forces for digital transformation that are creating change at an ever increasing pace. This creates a gap between the skills that workers have and the skills that they need. There requires an imperative for business and education to fill the gap. It is clear that a divide is found between the digital skills that people have and the skills that they think they have, called the “perception gap.” In other words, people think they are better at basic IT skills than they really are. In order to close this gap, educationalists must consider how to provide base level digital skills to the population as a whole. Traditional educational approaches do not have the capacity to achieve this, so the solution to this dilemma is often touted to be e-learning. This however leads to a paradox – can computers be used to learning computing? This talk proposes that blended learning is the necessary choice to ensure maximum inclusion and effective skills development.</p>

                            <h4 class="mb-10">Design a curriculum with user-experience analysis: case study computing science curriculum</h4>
                            <p>To improve the education, a new design of curriculum is always a part of the pro-cess. However, its development usually relies on the change of body of knowledge and class implementation. As a result, it might not succeed since it is compromised with issues in the deployment. In this paper, we propose to introduce a design concept on user experience (UX), which is extensively studied in the software engineering and computer science research, as a design tool. When the curriculum is improved, not only the body of knowledge is changed, the changes also affect all related resources and activities. If some of them was not well prepared, it would become the obstructions. The UX design/analysis is a process that uses meaningful experiences of all users in all aspects, such as resources, management, usability, and implementation. All related action roles to the system in the past is needed to be analyzed. The new curriculum should be designed based on possibility of implementation and optimized based on the user experience in the future. We introduce the study of computing science curriculum design for basic education. The case study has discussions on the analysis, the objective layout on the curriculum development, and the design of the curriculum.</p>
