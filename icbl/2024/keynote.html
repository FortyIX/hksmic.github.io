							<p>Building a Learner-Centric Citywide Digital Literacy Ecosystem: Train-the-Trainer, Community-Based Learning, and Gifted Education<br />Abstract: In today's digital era, ensuring digital literacy for all individuals is essential for their success and participation in society. Additionally, recognizing and nurturing the talents of gifted learners is crucial for fostering innovation and advancing communities. This talk explores the concept of building a learner-centric citywide digital literacy ecosystem that incorporates train-the-trainer programs, community-based learning, and a gifted education approach. By placing learners at the center of this ecosystem, we can create a comprehensive framework that empowers individuals, bridges the digital divide, and fosters the growth and development of their communities. The Hour of Code Hong Kong citywide campaign started in 2014, and the HKSAR Gifted Education Fund programme will be used as an example to cover the breadth and depth components of the learning process to evaluate the impact and overall performance of the students involved along the journey. Through collaboration, innovation, and a commitment to learner-centered approaches, we can build thriving ecosystems that embrace the opportunities of the digital age and empower learners to succeed in the 21st century.</p>

							<p>How to Design Scientific, Happy, and Effective Educational Games: Research on the Design of Educational Games from the Perspective of Learning Sciences<br />Abstract: As a hot topic in educational technology research, educational games have been widely used but have not yet been fully integrated into classroom teaching. Their design and development face challenges, and creating scientific, happy, and effective educational games poses a significant hurdle. Learning sciences, as an interdisciplinary field, provides a new perspective for designing the educational games. By combining the concepts and methods of learning sciences, more scientific, happy, and effective educational games can be designed to enhance learning outcomes. Therefore, this speech will combine the research case of the Lab of Learning Sciences at Peking University to explore how to design and develop educational games from the perspective of learning sciences, and explore the difficulties and obstacles involved.</p>

							<p>Blended Learning and AI: Enhancing Teaching and Learning in Higher Education<br />Abstract: Learner engagement is essential for positive student learning experiences and outcomes. While the higher education sector has accumulated years of experience with learner engagement with conventional face-to-face instruction, it is also placing increasingly more emphasis on the combination of in-person and online teaching and learning (T&L) activities, which enhances T&L in multiple ways. Promoting and supporting learner engagement in blended learning environment is receiving increasingly greater attention and scrutiny in recent years. This keynote presentation will be situated in an AI-infused T&L landscape: the speaker will survey recent scholarship on AI and blended learning and share her insights into strategies for delivering blended learning to maximise the benefit for instructors and learners in the emerging technology-enhanced learning environments of higher education.</p>

							<p>Digital Literacy: Evolution, Evaluation and Enhancement<br />Abstract: Digital literacy (DL) has increasingly assumed paramount importance in the digital age, emerging as a vital essential skillset. This study begins by retrospecting on the three evolutionary stages of DL, delineating the characteristics unique to each phase. It observes that the connotation of DL has been continually expanded and refined with the progression of time. Subsequently, by analyzing current international standards and frameworks for DL, and integrating the developmental context and specific traits of Chinese students and teachers, this research constructs a DL conceptual framework for students and a DL conceptual framework for teachers. Thereafter, using the student population as an example, the study developed a DL evaluation tool based on the conceptual framework and presented the results of evaluating students' DL in a large-scale study conducted in six Chinese provinces. Finally, the study provides concrete and feasible recommendations for improving DL of teachers and students.</p>
