# About ICBL

The International Conference on Blended Learning (ICBL) is an annual international conference with the main focus on blended learning - an integration of the traditional learning with innovative means, such as e-learning and open online learning, in order to create a new learning environment to enhance learning effectiveness and enrich learning experience. The purpose is to bring together researchers and developers from education and computer science to advance the research of blended learning.

ICBL together with its predecessors ICHL had attracted hundreds of delegates from many countries and regions, including China, Hong Kong, Macao, Taiwan, Japan, Singapore, Korea, Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, Australia, Czech Republic, France, Germany, UK, Canada, and USA.
